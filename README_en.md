## Configuration Options

The PHP Directory Explorer provides a simple way to browse files and directories on your server. Using the `config.php` file, you can adjust the explorer's behavior and appearance. To get started, rename `config.example.php` to `config.php` and configure the following options:

### General Settings

#### Root and Files Directory
- **`ROOT_PATH`**: The main folder from which files and directories are displayed. By default, this is the parent directory of the `config` folder.
- **`FILES_DIRECTORY`** *(Optional)*: A specific directory whose files should be displayed. If empty or invalid, `ROOT_PATH` will be used.

#### Privacy Information
- **`DATA_CONTROLLER_NAME`**: Your name or your company's name.
- **`DATA_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS`**: Your address for legal or contact purposes.
- **`DATA_CONTROLLER_EMAIL`**: The email address for contact inquiries.
- **`DATA_CONTROLLER_EMAIL_ALIAS`**: An alias like "Contact Us" instead of displaying the email address.

### Filtering and Display Options

#### Exclude Directories and Files
- **`IGNORE_DIR_PATTERNS`**: List of directories to ignore (e.g., `vendor`, `.git*`).
- **`IGNORE_FILE_PATTERNS`**: Files to exclude (e.g., `*.log`, `index.php`).

#### Define Exceptions
- **`ALLOW_DIR_PATTERNS`**: Directories to display even if listed in the ignore patterns.
- **`ALLOW_FILE_PATTERNS`**: Files to display even if listed in the ignore patterns.

#### Directory Aliases
- **`DIRECTORY_ALIASES`**: Assign user-friendly names to certain directories, e.g., map `tmp` to "Temporary".

### Appearance Customization

#### Titles and Logo
- **`APP_TITLE`**: The main title displayed at the top of the page.
- **`APP_SUBTITLE`** *(Optional)*: A subtitle or short description.
- **`APP_LOGO_URL`** *(Optional)*: URL or path to a logo (PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG). If no logo is provided, the layout is centered.

#### Footer and Navigation Texts
- **`COPYRIGHT_YEAR`**: Automatically displays the current year in the footer.
- **`COPYRIGHT_OWNER`**: Your name or company displayed in the footer.
- **`FOOTER_TEXT`**: Customizable text for additional notes or disclaimers.
- **`NAVIGATION_TITLE`**: Title displayed above the navigation bar.
- **`BROWSER_TITLE`**: Title displayed above the file and folder list.

### Usage Examples

With these settings, you can tailor the explorer for various scenarios, such as:
- Displaying files from a specific directory.
- Customizing the design to match your branding.
- Excluding or including directories and files to simplify the interface.

For more details, refer to the comments in the `config.php` file. Enjoy customizing!
